              <p>
                If you‚Äôre a frontend developer engaged in building highly
                interactive user interfaces, you‚Äôve most likely got React in
                your toolkit. While working on your React-powered creations, you
                should be careful to do things in tune with the React best
                practices. This will help to keep your code better organized.

                  <h4>üêõ 1. Keep components small and function-specific</h4>
                  <br />
                  <p>
                    As we all know, with React, it‚Äôs possible to have huge
                    components that execute a number of tasks. But a better way
                    to design components is to keep them small, so that one
                    component corresponds to one function. Ideally, a single
                    component should render a specific bit of your page or
                    modify a particular behavior. There are many advantages to
                    this:
                  </p>
                  <ol class="blog-details-list">
                    <li>
                      Function-specific components can be standalone, which
                      makes
                      <a
                        class="ho-color"
                        target="_blank"
                        href="https://www.codeinwp.com/blog/best-cross-browser-testing-tools/"
                        >testing
                      </a>
                      and maintenance easier.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Each small component can be reused across multiple
                      projects.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Components executing general functions can be made
                      available to the community.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      With smaller components, it‚Äôs easier to implement
                      performance optimizations.
                    </li>
                    <li>It‚Äôs easier to update smaller components.</li>
                    <li>
                      Bigger components have to perform harder and may be
                      difficult to maintain.
                    </li>
                  </ol>

                  <br />
                  <h4>
                    ‚ôªÔ∏è 2. Reusability is important, so keep creation of new
                    components to the minimum required
                  </h4>
                  <br />

                  <p>
                    By sticking to the rule of one function = one component, you
                    can improve the reusability of components. What this means
                    is that you should skip trying to build a new component for
                    a function if there already exists a component for that
                    function.
                    <br /><br />
                    By reusing components across your project or across any
                    number of projects, not only will you achieve consistency,
                    you‚Äôll also be contributing to the community.
                    <br /><br />
                    On the other hand, if any component becomes huge, unwieldy
                    and difficult to maintain, it‚Äôs better to break it up into
                    as many smaller components as required.
                    <br /><br />
                    For example, you can even go further and create a Button
                    component that can handle icons. Then, each time you need a
                    button, you‚Äôll have a component to use. Making it more
                    modular will allow you to cover many cases with the same
                    piece of code. You have to aim somewhere in the middle. Your
                    components should be abstract enough, but shouldn‚Äôt be
                    overly complex.
                  </p>

                  <br />
                  <h4>ü§ù 3. Consolidate duplicate code ‚Äì DRY your code</h4>
                  <br />
                  <p>
                    A common rule for all code is to keep it as brief and
                    concise as possible.
                    <br /><br />
                    It‚Äôs no different here too, since React best practices also
                    instruct you to keep code brief and precise. One way to do
                    this is to avoid duplication ‚Äì Don‚Äôt Repeat Yourself (DRY).
                    <br /><br />
                    You can achieve this by scrutinizing the code for patterns
                    and similarities. If you find any, it‚Äôs possible you‚Äôre
                    repeating code and there‚Äôs scope to eliminate duplication.
                    Most likely, a bit of rewriting can make it more concise.
                    <br /><br />
                    This relies heavily on the reusability principle in React.
                    Let‚Äôs say you want to add multiple buttons that contain
                    icons, instead of adding the markup for each button, you can
                    simply use the IconButton component that we shown above. You
                    could even go further by mapping everything into an array.
                  </p>

                  <br />
                  <h4>üé® 4. Put CSS in JavaScript</h4>
                  <br />
                  <p>
                    When you start working on a project, it is a common practice
                    to keep all the CSS styles in a single SCSS file. The use of
                    a global prefix prevents any potential name collisions.
                    However, when your project scales up, this solution may not
                    be feasible.
                    <br /><br />
                    There are many libraries that enable you to write CSS in JS.
                    <a
                      class="ho-color"
                      target="_blank"
                      href="https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion"
                      >EmotionJS
                    </a>
                    and
                    <a
                      class="ho-color"
                      target="_blank"
                      href="https://glamorous.rocks/"
                      >Glamorous
                    </a>
                    are the two most popular CSS in JS libraries.
                    <br /><br />
                    Here‚Äôs an example of using EmotionJS in your project.
                    EmotionJS can generate complete CSS files for your
                    production. First, install EmotionJS using npm.
                    <br /><br />
                    Next, you need to import EmotionJS in your application.
                    <br /><br />
                    You can set the properties of an element as shown in the
                    snippet below:
                    <br /><br />
                    Here is the link to the complete
                    <a
                      class="ho-color"
                      target="_blank"
                      href="https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction"
                      >documentation of EmotionJS.
                    </a>
                  </p>

                  <br />
                  <h4>üìù 5. Comment only where necessary</h4>
                  <br />
                  <p>
                    Attach comments to code only where necessary. This is not
                    only in keeping with React best practices, it also serves
                    two purposes at the same time:
                  </p>
                  <ul class="blog-details-list">
                    <li>It‚Äôll keep code visually clutter free.</li>
                    <li>
                      You‚Äôll avoid a potential conflict between comment and
                      code, if you happen to alter the code at some later point
                      in time.
                    </li>
                  </ul>

                  <br />
                  <h4>üìõ 6. Name the component after the function</h4>
                  <br />
                  <p>
                    It‚Äôs a good idea to name a component after the function that
                    it executes so that it‚Äôs easily recognizable.
                    <br /><br />
                    For example, ProductTable ‚Äì it conveys instantly what the
                    component does. On the other hand, if you name the component
                    based on the need for the code, it can confuse you at a
                    future point of time.
                    <br /><br />
                    Another example, it‚Äôs preferable to name a component Avatar
                    so that it can be used anywhere ‚Äì for authors, users or in
                    comments. Instead, if we name the component AuthorAvatar in
                    the context of its usage, we‚Äôd be limiting the utility of
                    that component.
                    <br /><br />
                    Besides, naming a component after the function makes it more
                    useful to the community as it‚Äôs more likely to be
                    discovered.
                  </p>

                  <br />
                  <h4>ü¶í 7. Use capitals for component names</h4>
                  <br />
                  <p>
                    If, like most folks, you‚Äôre using JSX (a JavaScript
                    extension), the names of the components you create need to
                    begin with uppercase letters. For instance, you‚Äôll name
                    components as SelectButton instead of selectbutton, or Menu
                    instead of menu. We do this so that JSX can identify them
                    differently from default HTML tags.
                    <br /><br />
                    Earlier React versions maintained a list of all built-in
                    names to differentiate them from custom names. But as the
                    list needed constant updating, that was scrapped and
                    capitals became the norm.
                    <br /><br />
                    In case JSX is not your language of choice, you can use
                    lowercase letters. However, this may reduce the reusability
                    of components beyond your project.
                  </p>
                  <br />
                  <h4>üê´ 8. Mind the other naming conventions</h4>
                  <br />
                  <p>
                    When working with React, you are generally using JSX
                    (JavaScript Extension) files. Any component that you create
                    for React should therefore be named in Pascal case, or upper
                    camel case. This translates to names without spaces and the
                    capitalizing the first letter of every word.
                    <br /><br />
                    If you want to create a function that submits a form, you
                    should name it SubmitForm in upper camel case, rather than
                    submitForm, submit_form, or submit_form. Upper camel case is
                    more commonly called Pascal case. Here is a further
                    <a
                      class="ho-color"
                      target="_blank"

                    </a>

                  <br />
                  <h4>üé≠ 9. Separate stateful aspects from rendering</h4>
                  <br />
                  <p>
                    Components in React can be stateful or stateless. Stateful
                    components store information about the component‚Äôs state and
                    provide the necessary context. In contrast, stateless
                    components have no memory and cannot give context to other
                    parts of the UI. They only receive props (inputs) from
                    parent component and return you JSX elements. They are
                    scalable and reusable, and similar to pure function in
                    JavaScript.
                    <br /><br />
                    One of React best practices is to keep your stateful
                    data-loading logic separate from your rendering stateless
                    logic. It‚Äôs better to have one stateful component to load
                    data and another stateless component to display that data.
                    This reduces the complexity of the components.
                    <br /><br />
                    The later React versions v16.8 have a new feature ‚Äì React
                    Hooks, which write stateful function-related components.
                    This may eventually eliminate the need for class-based
                    components.
                    <br /><br />
                    For example, your app is fetching some data on mount. What
                    you want to do is manage the data in the main component and
                    pass the complex
                    <a
                      class="ho-color"
                      target="_blank"
                      href="https://www.codeinwp.com/blog/free-react-native-templates/"
                      >render task
                    </a>
                    to a sub-component as props.
                  </p>

                  <br />
                  <h4>
                    üöÄ 10. Code should execute as expected and be testable
                  </h4>
                  <br />
                  <p>
                    Really, this rule needs no explanation. The code you write
                    should behave as expected, and be testable easily and
                    quickly. It‚Äôs a good practice to name your test files
                    identical to the source files with a .test suffix. It‚Äôll
                    then be easy to find the test files.
                    <br /><br />
                    You can use JEST to test your React code.
                  </p>
                  <br />
                  <h4>
                    üìÅ 11. All files related to any one component should be in a
                    single folder
                  </h4>
                  <br />
                  <p>
                    Keep all files relating to any one component in a single
                    folder, including styling files.
                    <br /><br />
                    If there‚Äôs any small component used by a particular
                    component only, it makes sense to keep these smaller
                    components all together within that component folder. The
                    hierarchy will then be easy to understand ‚Äì large components
                    have their own folder and all their smaller parts are split
                    into sub-folders. This way, you can easily extract code to
                    any other project or even modify the code whenever you want.
                    <br /><br />
                    For instance, for the Form component, all pieces such as CSS
                    files, icons, images, tests and any other sub-components
                    relating to Form should all reside in the same folder. If
                    you name files sensibly, and keep related files together
                    logically, you‚Äôll not have any difficulty finding them
                    later.

                  <br />
                  <p>
                    One of React best practices that helps to organize all your
                    React components is the use of tools like Bit .
                    <br /><br />
                    These tools help to maintain and reuse code. Beyond that, it
                    helps code to become discoverable, and promotes team
                    collaboration in building components. Also, code can be
                    synced across projects.

                  <br />
                  <h4>üìö 13. Use snippet libraries</h4>
                  <br />
                  <p>
                    Code snippets help you to keep up with the best and most
                    recent syntax. They also help to keep your code relatively
                    bug free, so this is one of the React best practices that
                    you should not miss out on.
                    <br /><br />
                    There are many snippet libraries that you can use, like, ES7
                    React, Redux, JS Snippets, etc.
                  </p>

                  <br />
                  <h4>‚úçÔ∏è 14. Write tests for all code</h4>
                  <br />
                  <p>
                    In any programming language, adequate testing ensures that
                    any new code added to your project integrates well with
                    existing code and does not break existing functionality. It
                    is a good idea to write tests for any new component that you
                    create. As a good practice, you should create a __Test__
                    directory within your component‚Äôs directory to house all
                    relevant tests.
                    <br /><br />
                    You can broadly divide tests in React into two parts:
                    testing the functionality of components using a React app,
                    and tests on your complete application once it renders in
                    the browser. You can use
                    <a
                      class="ho-color"
                      target="_blank"
                      href="https://www.codeinwp.com/blog/best-cross-browser-testing-tools/"
                      >cross browser testing tools
                    </a>
                    for tests in the latter category. <br /><br />
                    For the former, you can use a JavaScript test runner,
                    <a
                      class="ho-color"
                      target="_blank"
                      href="https://jestjs.io/"
                      >Jest
                    </a>
                    to emulate the HTML DOM using jsdom to test React
                    components. While a completely accurate test is only
                    possible in a browser on a real device, Jest provides a good
                    approximation of the real testing environment during the
                    development phase of your project.

                  <br />
                  <p>
                    Linting is a process wherein we run a program that analyses
                    code for potential errors.

                    <br /><br />
                    Mostly, we use it for language-related issues. But it can
                    also fix many other issues automatically, particularly code
                    style. Using a linter in your React code helps to keep your
                    code relatively error- and bug-free.
