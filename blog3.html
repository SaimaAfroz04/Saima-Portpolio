              <p>
                If you’re a frontend developer engaged in building highly
                interactive user interfaces, you’ve most likely got React in
                your toolkit. While working on your React-powered creations, you
                should be careful to do things in tune with the React best
                practices. This will help to keep your code better organized.

                    Here at Stillio, it's paramount that we take care of the
                    code we write. We process thousands of images and people
                    rely on us for making sure their screenshots get delivered.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Recently, we found something that might be interesting about
                    Promise.all().
                  </p>
                  <img src="  assets/images/blog/1.png" alt="" />
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  <small
                    ><a
                      class="ho-color"
                      target="_blank"
                      href="https://na8an-web.github.io/Adrian/assets/images/blog/1.png"
                      >A handy feature of Promise.all is that it will give back
                      the results in the order that the promise array was given,
                      let's look at a more robust example:</a
                    ></small
                  >

                  <br />
                  <br />
                  <img src="  assets/images/blog/2.png" alt="" />

                  <br />
                  <br />

                  <h4>Description</h4>
                  <br />
                  <p>
                    Above we have a fake urlArray variable. Assume that this is
                    actual urls that we want to fetch. Since fetching is an
                    async event we simulate that with the function asyncAction.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    All asyncAction actually does is return a promise which
                    resolves at a random interval between 0 and 5000ms. This is
                    to simulate changes in network latency, not all requests
                    respond in the exact same time.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    To create an Array of Promises, we map the urlArray and
                    return a new Array with the Promises after calling
                    asyncAction. These aren't resolved yet, so we use
                    Promise.all() in start() to give us an Array of results and
                    since the function just returns the number:
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    The results demonstrate that even though each request took a
                    considerable different amount of time to complete, the
                    Promise.all() method made sure that the results were
                    returned in the correct order, hooray there's reliability!
                    Or is there...
                  </p>
                  <br />
                  <h4>Where Promise.all() gets interesting</h4>
                  <br />
                  <p>
                    Let's look at the above example again, but this time we
                    change some things up. In the fake request let's update the
                    resolve function to this:
                  </p>
                  <br />
                  <img src="  assets/images/blog/3.png" alt="" />
                  <br />
                  <br />

                  <a
                    class="ho-color"
                    target="_blank"
                    href="https://na8an-web.github.io/Adrian/assets/images/blog/3.png"
                  >
                    We've added a date component to the result of the Promise.
                    This is actually something that we required in our code
                    base. We had to process multiple URLs in an Array
                    asynchronously and give it a timestamp that was congruent to
                    the order of the Array. Sounds like the perfect job for
                    Promise.all(). Let's run the code again with the timestamp
                    component included, here's the result:</a
                  >

                  <br />
                  <br />

                  <img src="  assets/images/blog/5.png" alt="" />

                  <br />
                  <br />

                  <a
                    class="ho-color"
                    target="_blank"
                    href="https://na8an-web.github.io/Adrian/assets/images/blog/5.png"
                    >As you can see, Item 10 was created ~1s before item 1 was
                    created. Even though the method maintained the order of the
                    Promise resolutions, there was this effect that timestamps
                    were dependent on these random intervals. <br /><br />
                    This makes sense if you think about it, because
                    fundamentally the issue already arose in the loop - when
                    generating the promises. The loop doesn't wait for the
                    previous promise to arrive for the next one to be made -
                    it's still just a Promise.</a
                  >

                  <br />
                  <br />
                  <h4>The alternative approach</h4>
                  <br />

                  <img src=" assets/images/blog/4.png" alt="" />
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  <p>
                    The code above is very similar, except we've removed
                    promise.all() and replaced it with a simple for of loop. On
                    each iteration, we HAVE to wait for the previous result,
                    because of await. The outcome is:
                  </p>
                  <br />
                  <img src="  assets/images/blog/6.png" alt="" />

                      target="_blank"
                      href="https://na8an-web.github.io/Adrian/assets/images/blog/6.png"
                      >The results are ordered and so is the time component.
                      This was what was actually expected.</a
                    >
                  </p>

                  <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                  <br />
                  <p>
                    Promise.all() is a super handy tool but because of it's
                    abstraction, it's easy to overlook something like a time
                    component. Keep in mind, the first example ran much quicker
                    than the second, since the timers didn't need to complete
                    before the next result was fired.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    So in general, if there is an element of time. e.g. a
                    dateCreated property on the results of a list of Promises or
                    asynchronous actions, consider using a loop instead of
                    Promise.all().
